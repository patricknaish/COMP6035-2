Run "make" to build and run all parts.
Run "make buildpart1" to build and run just part 1 (or 2, or 3).
Run "make buildall" to build all files without running.
Run "make clean" to remove compiled files.

If you do not have make installed, please compile the files with "g++ -std=c++11".

Please note that echo commands in the makefile will not behave correctly in some implementations.
